              1.1 <a href="Upstart-Default-Predictability-01.html">Default Predictability</a>: Key takeaway: Upstart’s model is different and it identifies the borrowers with different risk levels conditional on output of traditional models (i.e. within each risk level as given by the traditional model). Upstart is able to identify risk that is orthogonal to risk measured by traditional models.
